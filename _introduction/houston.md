## Traffic management for your all your teams

Houston is a traffic management solution that helps every team operate
microservices more effectively. It is built on top of CNCF's
[Envoy](https://envoyproxy.github.io), a modern traffic proxy. Envoy has an
enormously capable toolkit for load balancing, resilience, observability, and
modernization. Houston configures a single Envoy or a fleet of them from our
hosted service, giving small teams the power to migrate to new infrastructure,
to expose new functionality, or to configure resilience strategies with
real-time feedback.
