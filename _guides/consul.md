In our examples below, we'll assume a Consul install on a local development
machine, listening on the machine's IP address (_not_ localhost) on port 8500,
with a datacenter named \"dc1\", but the concepts should extend to a larger
installation. We'll also assume a working docker installation. "

%}

## Setting up service discovery

First, install and run tbncollect on an instance of server of your choice,
with your environment variables defined inside of the Docker command, using
the `signed_token` you obtained with `tbnctl`:

```console
$ docker run -d \
  -e "TBNCOLLECT_API_KEY=<your signed_token>" \
  -e "TBNCOLLECT_API_ZONE_NAME=<your zone name>" \
  -e "TBNCOLLECT_CMD=consul" \
  -e "TBNCOLLECT_CONSUL_DC=dc1" \
  -e "TBNCOLLECT_CONSUL_HOSTPORT=<your ip address>:8500" \
  turbinelabs/tbncollect:0.14.2
```

Use `tbncollect help consul` to determine which environmental variables you
can use and modify.

## The all-in-one demo

We'll use the same client application described in our [quickstart]({{
"/reference/#quick-start" | relative_url }}) for these examples. To start the all-in-one client, on port 8080, first run:

```console
$ docker run -p 8080:8080 -d turbinelabs/all-in-one-client:0.14.2
```

Then expose the container as a Consul service:

```console
$ curl <your ip address>:8500/v1/catalog/register -d '
{% include_relative examples/consul/all-in-one-client.json %}'
```

Now start the all-in-one server, on port 8081:

```console
$ docker run -d \
  -p 8081:8080 \
  -e "TBN_COLOR=1B9AE4" \
  -e "TBN_NAME=blue" \
  turbinelabs/all-in-one-server:0.14.2
```

Then expose the container as a Consul service:

```console
$ curl <your ip address>:8500/v1/catalog/register -d '
{% include_relative examples/consul/all-in-one-server-blue.json %}'
```

Ensure that these containers have started correctly by running:

```console
$ docker ps
```

```shell
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                                 COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                    NAMES

```

## Deploying tbnproxy

Now we're ready to deploy tbnproxy, using the `signed_token` you obtained with
`tbnctl`, along with the Zone and Proxy names:

```console
$ docker run -d \
  -p 80:80 \
  -e "TBNPROXY_API_KEY=<your signed_token>" \
  -e "TBNPROXY_API_ZONE_NAME=<your zone name>" \
  -e "TBNPROXY_PROXY_NAME=<your proxy name>" \
  turbinelabs/tbnproxy:0.14.2
```

## Verifying your deploy

You should now have tbnproxy running locally on port 80, serving both the all-
in-one client and server. Visit [localhost](http://localhost) in your browser to
verify.

### Deploying a new version

Now we'll deploy a new version of the server that returns green as the color to
paint blocks, on port 8082:

```console
$ docker run -d \
  -p 8082:8080 \
  -e "TBN_COLOR=83D061" \
  -e "TBN_NAME=green" \
  turbinelabs/all-in-one-server:0.14.2
```

Then expose the container as a Consul service:

```console
$ curl <your ip address>:8500/v1/catalog/register -d '
{% include_relative examples/consul/all-in-one-server-green.json %}'
```

Ensure that all containers have started correctly by running:

```console
$ docker ps
```

```shell
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                                 COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                          NAMES

### Driving synthetic traffic

If you'd like to drive steady traffic to your all-in-one server without keeping
a browser window open, you can run the all-in-one-driver image. If you are
running tbnproxy on a port other than 80, you'll need to specify it using the
`ALL_IN_ONE_DRIVER_HOST` environment variable. You can also add error rates and
latencies for various using environment variables:

```console
$ docker run -d \
  -e "ALL_IN_ONE_DRIVER_LATENCIES=blue:50ms,green:20ms" \
  -e "ALL_IN_ONE_DRIVER_ERROR_RATES=blue:0.01,green:0.005" \
  turbinelabs/all-in-one-driver:0.10.1
```
