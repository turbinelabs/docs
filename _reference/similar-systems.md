Houston is an application and routing and release system. It combines
capabilities usually found in web proxies, logging solutions and monitoring
tools. It's the synthesis of these things into a product squarely focused on
providing a flexible, yet stable experience to customers that sets it apart.

## Traffic Control

Houston can replace your existing web proxy, or work in conjunction
with it. By using Envoy, Houston supports finer grained request routing that
other proxies, and has a more detailed view of your deployed services.
tbnproxy is dynamically configured directly from the Turbine Labs API,
so changes to configuration are simple and responsive.

## Logging

Houston collects, stores, and visualizes all configuration and state changes
related to your software release. In most release systems the configuration and
management of logging collectors is tedious, error prone, and low fidelity.
Houston provides you a great solution out of the box, and can also integrate
with your existing logging systems, enriching the data you already collect and
store.

## Monitoring

Houston collects, stores, and visualizes a concise yet comprehensive set of
metrics that give you an easily digestible view of your site health. Most
monitoring systems require invasive instrumentation and provide an overwhelming
flood of metrics. Houston collects a focused set of metrics that let you
understand what your customers are seeing, without the code surgery. Houston
provides you a great high level picture of service health, and can forward
metrics to your monitoring system for a more detailed analysis of incidents
that arise.

## CI/CD

Houston understands that deploying code to hardware shouldn't be the same step
as releasing it to customers. Existing CI/CD tools are great for packaging and
deploying software, but don't integrate the logging, monitoring and traffic
control you need for a robust release to your customers. Houston integrates the
information you need to feel confident in your software release and increase
your pace of iteration.
