## Setting up service discovery

Install tbncollect with the following task definition filling in the bracketed
variables, including the `signed_token` obtained with `tbnctl`:

```console
$ aws ecs \
  register-task-definition \
  --family tbncollect \
  --container-definitions '
{% include_relative examples/ecs/tbncollect_spec.json %}'
```

With your task definition created, you can proceed to run Create Service from
the ECS control panel, or through the CLI:

```console
$ aws ecs \
  create-service \
  --cluster default \
  --service-name tbncollect \
  --task-definition tbncollect:1 \
  --desired-count 1
```

## The all-in-one demo

### Configure your tasks and containers

In order for tbncollect to see your all-in-one tasks, you'll need to add a
Cluster tag, which is attached to a container definition within a task
definition. Clusters are the grouping that tbncollect uses for services, and in
the case of ECS, are comprised of one or more tasks. A task can be one, or many
containers, but as long as the container includes the same Cluster tag as a
Docker label, the containers will be grouped together.

Please note that using the same label for each container in a task will give
you multiple instances inside a Cluster in the Turbine Labs service.

The construction of the tag inside of a task definition looks like this for the
server:

```json
{
  "dockerLabels": {
    "tbn-cluster": "all-in-one-server:8080"
  }
}
```

and this for the client:

```json
{
  "dockerLabels": {
    "tbn-cluster": "all-in-one-client:8080"
  }
}
```

The label key is the "Cluster tag", which will associate the container with a
Turbine Labs' Cluster, and the value is Turbine Labs' Cluster name and port.
Example task definitions are included later, which include these labels.

### Install the all-in-one-server

Next, create the following task definition for the
all-in-one-server-blue which returns the color blue to the all-in-one-client.

```console
$ aws ecs \
  register-task-definition \
  --family all-in-one-server-blue \
  --container-definitions '
{% include_relative examples/ecs/all_in_one_server_blue.json %}'
```

Create a service with this task definition on an ECS cluster of your choosing.

```console
$ aws ecs \
  create-service \
  --cluster default \
  --service-name all-in-one-server-blue \
  --task-definition all-in-one-server-blue:1 \
  --desired-count 1
```

### Install the all-in-one-client

The following task definition is for the all-in-one-client, which will
show the results of the color returned by the all-in-one-server visually as a
blue block.

```console
$ aws ecs \
  register-task-definition \
  --family all-in-one-client \
  --container-definitions '
{% include_relative examples/ecs/all_in_one_client.json %}'
```

Create a service with this task definition on your ECS cluster.

```console
$ aws ecs \
  create-service \
  --cluster default \
  --service-name all-in-one-client \
  --task-definition all-in-one-client:1 \
  --desired-count 1
```

{% include guides/adding_a_domain.md %}

### Create tbnproxy

Create tbnproxy with this task definition and note the NGINX variables you'll
need to modify with values for your environment. tbnproxy will be visible to
the web, and your customer's traffic. tbnproxy will also need network
connectivity to all ECS tasks.

This [tbnproxy task definition](examples/ecs/tbnproxy_spec.json) can be adapted
to your needs or environment, including the `signed_token` obtained with `tbnctl`:

```json
{% include_relative examples/ecs/tbnproxy_spec.json %}
```

Create a service with this task definition on your ECS cluster.

### Create a service to expose tbnproxy

With your task definition created, we can then expose tbnproxy to the internet using an Elastic Load Balancer. First create your ELB using the management console, with no listeners. Now expose tbnproxy to the ELB by running Create Service from the [ECS control panel](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/create-service.html#service-configure-load-balancing) or through the CLI:

```console
$ aws ecs \
  create-service \
  --cluster default \
  --service-name tbnproxy \
  --task-definition tbnproxy:1 \
  --desired-count 1
  --load-balancers <the ELB you created above goes here>
  ```

## Verifying your deploy

With your ELB running, locate its external IP, and visit it in your browser.
You should be able to see blue boxes in a grid, blinking in and out, as they
represent responses from the blue version of the all-in-one-server we launched
previously.

### Deploying a new version

Now we'll deploy a new version of the server that returns green as the color to
paint blocks. Use this task definition to create a service for a new server that
returns the color green to the all-in-one-client.

```console
$ aws ecs \
  register-task-definition \
  --family all-in-one-server-green \
  --container-definitions '
{% include_relative examples/ecs/all_in_one_server_green.json %}'
```

Create a service with this task definition on an ECS cluster of your choosing.

```console
$ aws ecs \
  create-service \
  --cluster default \
  --service-name all-in-one-server-green \
  --task-definition all-in-one-server-green:1 \
  --desired-count 1
```

### Driving synthetic traffic

If you'd like to drive steady traffic to your all-in-one server without keeping
a browser window open, you can run the all-in-one-driver image in your
kubernetes environment. You can use the template below, filling in the value for
`ALL_IN_ONE_DRIVER_HOST` with the external IP of your ELB. You can also add
error rates and latencies for various using environment variables.

```console
$ aws ecs \
  register-task-definition \
  --family all-in-one-driver \
  --container-definitions '
{% include_relative examples/ecs/all_in_one_driver.json %}'
```

With your task definition created, you can proceed to run Create Service from
the ECS control panel, or through the CLI:

```console
$ aws ecs \
  create-service \
  --cluster default \
  --service-name all-in-one-driver \
  --task-definition all-in-one-driver:1 \
  --desired-count 1
```
